# Architecture

Updated in the SAME change as any module boundary change.

## Layers (enforced by `forge.toml [layers]`)
Arrows mean "may include/call". Nothing points upward.

(Fill in from the preset; see preset README.)

`include/game/unit_020f6250.h`; resource data remains external to the handlers.
