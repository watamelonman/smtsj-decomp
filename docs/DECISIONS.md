## DEC-001 — Preserve the record setter's observed word argument
**Date:** 2026-10-21 · **Status:** Active
**Context.** `Unk0bb2b0_Unk_0bb450` passes an untruncated 32-bit sum in r1 to
`Unk02e000_SetRecordUnk1c`. The setter's separate source declares a u16 value,
and its implementation stores that value with a halfword store.
**Decision.** Declare the caller boundary with a u32 value, matching the original
register argument. A u16 caller declaration would add truncation instructions
absent from the original. See `docs/functions/game-unit-020bb2b0.md`.
**Cost accepted.** The local declaration describes the observed machine ABI,
rather than sharing the callee translation unit's narrower C parameter type.
**What would make us revisit.** Evidence of a shared original prototype or a
project-wide convention for reconciling these historical call boundaries.
